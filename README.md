Final Project 
DSCI-591

The purpose of this project is to create a model that can predict what house pricing will be in the future for two US cities.

Potential Use and Stakeholders

Anyone looking to buy a home within the next year or two would find this study helpful
Also, it could be useful for banks that provide home loans, mortgage companies, and escrow companies

Source of Data
Our data comes from datasets that were originally sourced from Kaggle, The second database used is a public-use database by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other platforms like  Zillow, Redfin.

Descriptions:

1) The " DSCI-591 Final Project folder" contains all the raw, pre-processed, and model-specific datasets.
    i.The data folder contains the .csv files holding data from 2018 up until the 2022 ongoing season, which is the dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset It is with this dataset that the code works, and thus this csv file should remain within the data folder. 

     ii. DSCI 591 Final Project.ipynb: This Python notebook contains the code used in achieving the outcome of our research. Additionally, it contains all the other pre-processing and feature engineering done when working on the dataset. This code is to be run as a normal jupyter notebook, though the user can use several functions present in the code to create plots as they need to. 

    iii. DSCI 591 Final Project Presentation.ppt: The ppt file contains a PowerPoint presentation that details the discoveries made over the course of the analysis.

Issues and Limitations
We were limited by the features that were available to us by our datasets. There are economic factors that could be considered in future work.
